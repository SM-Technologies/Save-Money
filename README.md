# Lets Cook - Food Market 💻🥼👜🧰

Samotech is a web application that allows users to search for a certain product (a cell phone, computer, appliances, etc.) and shows a list of the purchase options for that same product published in various ecommerce sites; such as Amazon, Mercado Libre, eBay, AliExpress, etc. At the top of the list, the product at the cheapest price of all sources is highlighted. In short, Samotech allows a user to buy a product at the cheapest price without the need for him to research and compare prices on different websites.

**SITE:** https://save-money-mzostaphd.vercel.app
